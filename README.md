### CCJS 710 - Advanced Statistics Methods: Limited Dependent Variables (Fall 2025)

* Course Catalog Description: Application of advanced data analysis strategies to criminological and criminal justice problems, with specific focus on limited dependent variables.
* Instructor: Robert Brame
* Office: LeFrak 2139
* Course Meets: Thursdays 4-6:45 in LeFrak 1220
* Office Hours: Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10-11:00
* Readings will be assigned throughout the semester.
* Course-related policies: In all matters, the class will follow University guidance as outlined [here](https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/graduate/policies/course-related-policies/).
* Accessibility accommodations: If you think you might need one or more academic accommodations, please contact the Accessibility and Disability Service Office ([link](https://ads.umd.edu)) for guidance and assistance. Please contact me to set up an appointment to discuss any accommodations that are authorized. 
* Letter grades: At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned on a 100-point scale (A+ = 98 and higher; A = 92-97; A- = 90-91; B+ = 88-89; B = 82-87; B- = 80-81; C+ = for 78-79; C = 72-77; C- = 70-71; D+ = 68-69; D = 62-67; D- = 60-61; and F = any grade less than 60). All numeric grades (including the final numeric grade in the class at the end of the semester) will be rounded off to the nearest 1 point (for example, a 78.5 would be rounded to a 79 and a 78.4 would be rounded to a 78).
* Numeric grades in this class will be based on 3 in-class exams; each exam will contribute equally to your final grade and each will be graded on a 100-point scale.
* Exam questions will be short-answer format and will require you to report and interpret calculations. I will give you practice questions as the exam dates approach.
* On exams, you must turn off your internet connection and not consult any artificial intelligence or any other support services for help. You will also be asked to write the University honor pledge on your exam and sign it.
* We will be using R statistical software ([link](https://www.r-project.org)) during class sessions; I will post relevant R code on this webpage.
